# Art and Fiber Crafting Ideas

* A Stringly-typed Python 
  * PyCon AU 2018 had a mascot known as "Curlyboi". When rendered in crochet, he is an example of a stringly-typed Python. [https://twitter.com/freakboy3742/status/1032560930633084929](https://twitter.com/freakboy3742/status/1032560930633084929)
  * **Proposal:**
    * The crochet pattern for curlyboi
    * An algorithmic generator for curlybois of arbitrary diameter \(The official pattern makes a curlyboi that is approximately the diameter of your thumb, but can be easily expanded to any size\).
    * \(optional\) An actual physical curlyboi
