"Do you have any underwear?"

"Excuse me?" the vendor at the PyCon booth looked thoroughly confused.

"I see you have BoGus Blockchain branded socks, and that will be very helpful, but do you have any blockchain underwear?"

"Uh... no..."

Myah noticed the vendor was looking increasingly uncomfortable, and back tracked. "I'm sorry for the odd question, it's just that my luggage was stolen from the hallway, and I'm trying to put together a wardrobe for tomorrow, and, uh, well, I guess I'll just continue my search..."

Myah glumly stuffed the purple socks into their PyCon swag bag, and walked out of the expo hall. A black roller bag whizzed past, and Myah jogged to take a look at it. "No rainbow strap," they muttered, and slowed to a walk.

"Hey, Myah, are you going to any sprints today?"

Myah looked up to see their friend Jace in front of a series of poster boards, and went over to scan the sprints schedule. "Eh, I might go hang out with the Zulip community and hack with them. But I can't work for long because my laptop power cord is in my luggage, and it was stolen."

"What?!? Someone stole your luggage?"

"Yeah, I left it outside the bathroom and when I came back, it was gone!"

"Did you tell the conference organizers?"

"Yep. They said they'd keep an eye out for it. If you see a black roller bag with a rainbow strap around the middle, let me know."

"Bummer. I'll keep an eye out for it." Myah sighed and nodded. "Hey, why don't you hang out with me in the Circuit Python open space? It would keep your mind off your lost luggage."

"Yeah, that sounds fun!"

The Circuit Python room was crowded. Everyone was focused on programming the tiny Gemma boards connected via USB cables to their computers. Myah spotted a larger group gathered around a tangle of wires and wheels. "What's that?"


Outline
===

- person has their luggage stolen from the staff room at PyCon
- collects t-shirts and socks from vendors - laments the lack of underwear options
- goes to the PyLadies auction - intense scene with bidding over the hoverboard and cape (eh, this part might not make sense in the timeline. If they're leaving PyCon for an evening flight, why would they go to the auction? But people who bought the board at the auction could be hacking the hoverboard at the open spaces.)
- learns circuit bending from the Circuit Python folks, hacks the speed of the hoverboard to go super fast
- sees their luggage after the auction, chases down the thief (who is confused by the yelling and hides behind the schedule signs rather than running)
- turns out the person took the luggage by mistake
- everyone is happy! Yay!
