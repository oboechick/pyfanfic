**EXT. SHOP - MID MORNING**  


**A shopfront, with display wheels of cheese in the window, signage reading "The Cheese Shop". A small sign hides just out of eyeline, reading: "Visit our new store", but with the rest of these details too small to see.**  


**The odd car passes by.**  


**CUSTOMER walks by, doubles back a pace, and enters the store.**  
  


**CUT TO:**  


**INT SHOP**  


**CUSTOMER**  


**Good morning!**  
  


**SHOPKEEPER**  


**\(jovial\) Good morning! Welcome to the CheeseShop!**  


**CUSTOMER**  
  


**Oh! Thank you, ma'am.**  
  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**What can I do for you, my dear?**  
  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Well, I was, uh, sitting at my co-working space on Spencer Street just now, skimming through some code review, and suddenly I came over all developish.**  


**SHOPKEEPER**  


**Developish, dear?**  


**CUSTOMER**  


**An inkling for some coding, like.**  


**SHOPKEEPER**  


**Eh?**  


**CUSTOMER**  


**I wish to partake in some software development!**  


**SHOPKEEPER**  


**Ah, yes! Coding!**  


**CUSTOMER**  


**In a nutshell. And I thought to myself, 'ah, why create from scratch when I can leverage the work of countless others and develop in an efficient manner!**  


**SHOPKEEPER**  


**Come again?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**I want to download some packages.**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Oh! Here I was thinking you were going to form a startup.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Oh, gosh no! I am one who enjoys just the odd dabble in developmental bliss. Now! Some packages, my good ma'am.**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Certainly, dear! What would you like?**  
  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**I was looking for &lt;requests&gt;**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Well, yes, I just asked you that. What is your request?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**No, &lt;requests&gt;. You know, for humans?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**\(slightly taken aback\) Well I should hope for humans, I wouldn't exactly like to serve my wares to a mouse, now would I?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**That's not what I... okay, what about &lt;BeautifulSoup&gt;?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**I'm not sure if I've ever thought a stew to be becoming, dear.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Eh?... okay, let me try something else.. what about &lt;pickle&gt;**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Pickles?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**You know, for serialization**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Why would you preserve Honey Oats? I mean...**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Honeyed Oats? Are you mad?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**

  
**Well you're the one wanting to put rice crispies in a jar with vinegar for weeks at a time.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**What are you on about?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  
  


**You just asked for pickled cereal?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**No I didn't, I just want to get some basic packages. So I don't have to make my own.**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Yes, okay, that's something I can help with. Though don't under-estimate the homemade marmalade.**  


**CUSTOMER**  


**\*deep sigh\***  


**Look, maybe you have something simple, like &lt;twine&gt;**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Twine, sure! But that's only if you're giftwrapping, and you haven't purchased anything yet.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Okay, what about if I get &lt;bottle&gt;**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**A bottle of what?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Sorry?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Well, normally when we sell bottles, there's stuff in it.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Fair enough. What about &lt;pandas&gt;**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**... Pandas?**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**Yes.**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Big things. Black and white. Eat bamboo.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**No...?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**Oh thank goodness, I thought you wanted to buy a pair of \*bears\***  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**No, I don't want a bear, I just want a package. Just one.**

  
 **SHOPKEEPER**  


 **So.. what do you want?**  
  


 **CUSTOMER**

**Well, since I seem to have exhausted \_everything\_ I've hoped I'd find ... do you have \*anything\*?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**'Fraid not.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**\(pause\) Come again?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**See, this location is no longer in operation. They've moved all stock to the new store.**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**.. what store?**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**&lt;The Warehouse&gt; https://pypi.org/**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**\(pause\)**  


 **SHOPKEEPER**  


**\(pause\)**  


 **CUSTOMER**  


**\(slams head onto countertop\)**  
  


**FADE OUT: TO BLACK**
