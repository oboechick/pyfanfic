This is a visual novel written in renpy centred around PyCon AU 2018.
From finding out and registering for the conference, to attending and going to talks, and maybe even some social activities on the side; This visual novel will attempt to recreate the PyCon AU 2018 experience in a visual novel. Relive the fun and explore new paths with different endings depending on your choices during the conference.

This project was started at the conference and hopes to seek permission to include links to the actual conference talks to feature as part of the experience. However, it currently only includes fictional characters.
