A Stringly-typed Python
=======================

PyCon AU 2018 had a mascot known as "Curlyboi". When rendered in crochet, he is an example of a stringly-typed Python.

Proposal:
---------

* The crochet pattern for curlyboi

* An algorithmic generator for curlybois of arbitrary diameter (The official pattern makes a curlyboi that is approximately the diameter of your thumb, but can be easily expanded to any size).

* (optional) An actual physical curlyboi
