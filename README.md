# Python Of Our Own (PO3)
> OH: This is just Python 2.7 fanfic, isn't it?

Basically, we're making an anthology of Python fan writing and art. Python can be a character, a major plot point, or whatever makes sense for your story, but Python *must* be a key part of the creative work you contribute.

## Submission guidelines
* Keep it [PG-13](https://www.thoughtco.com/how-does-a-movie-get-its-rating-2423408)
* Avoid involving real humans without permission (you can write about yourself without permission, we guess)
* Stories can’t violate the [PyCon CoC](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/code-of-conduct/)
* Short stories, art, poetry are all welcome
* Submit pitches through GitHub (contact us by commenting here if GitHub isn’t an option for your submission). Add your pitch to the appropriate folder — create a short description in a new .md in the folder.

## Money and Licensing
First off, there is no money. This anthology is a labor of love and your submission is a contribution to the PyLadies Auction. We’re planning to make the anthology available online for free. We’ll also be printing a limited run of copies as a fundraiser for [PyLadies](http://www.pyladies.com/). Those print copies will only be available to contributors and through the PyLadies Auction at PyCon 2019 in Cleveland.

We’ll be using a [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/) (free to share, as long as everything is attributed correctly). We’d also like any contributors to consider offering any originals (especially art) as an additional donation for the PyLadies auction.
